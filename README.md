# Cisco-Task
Designing computer network using Cisco

This task involves designing a secure network for the Universityâ€™s IT Centre and Department buildings using the 10.20.0.0/16 IP range. The network will use subnets and VLANs to segment areas like labs, offices, and meeting rooms, ensuring restricted access as needed. A network diagram will show IP assignments, routers, switches, and WiFi access points, with configurations for inter-VLAN routing, security policies, and encrypted WiFi. Routers and switches will be configured to enforce access controls, and only administrators will have access to each network node. The report will include IP allocation, security measures, and configuration details.
